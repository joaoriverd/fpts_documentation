%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current

% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's

% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***

Fixed-priority scheduling with preemption thresholds (FPTS) is supported by the AUTOSAR and OSEK standards as a scheduling policy. Since FPTS is a generalization of fixed-priority preemptive scheduling (FPPS) and fixed-priority non-preemptive scheduling (FPNS), it aims to improve schedulability. In this paper, we prove, as an intermediate step towards the exact best-case response time analysis for FPTS, that the best-case computation time of a non-preemptive task scheduled under FPTS or FPNS is a tight lower bound for its response time. In addition, we illustrate by means of an example that the best-case response time analysis for FPTS is most likely not a straight forward extension of the current best-case analysis for FPPS.

\section{Introduction}
Fixed-priority scheduling with preemption thresholds (FPTS) was first introduced in the ThreadX kernel \cite{TX} to limit the number of preemptions that a task may experience with the aim to improve schedulability and reduce preemption overheads compared to fixed-priority preemptive scheduling (FPPS). It is currently also supported by the automotive standards AUTOSAR and OSEK \iffalse\cite{AUT10}\cite{OSEK05} \fi[2, 3]. Although the worst-case response time analysis for FPTS has been studied extensively in the literature \iffalse\cite{WS99} \cite{R02} \cite{KRL05}\fi [4-6], little attention has been paid to its best-case counterpart.

FPTS is a generalization of FPPS and fixed-priority non-preemptive scheduling (FPNS). Therefore, it could be desirable to consider first the best-case response time analysis for FPPS and FPNS before investigating the corresponding analysis for FPTS. In particular, the best-case response time analysis for FPPS has been addressed in \cite{RS02} for constraint deadlines and in \cite{BLM13} for arbitrary deadlines. On the other hand, the best-case response time for FPNS has not been formally studied. 

FPNS is widely used in message-based protocols under a network environment. For example, the Controller Area Network (CAN) uses a priority based arbitration and non-preemptive scheduling for message transmission. Furthermore, special attention has been paid to the worst-case analysis for CAN in \cite{DBBL07}, and for FPNS in \cite{BLV09} to guarantee real-time requirements. However, when considering jitter induced by a network, it becomes relevant to study best-case response times next to worst-case response times of messages scheduled under FPNS.

In \cite{BV05}, a lower bound for the best-case response time under fixed-priority scheduling with deferred preemptions (FPDS) is presented. Since FPNS is a special case of FPDS, this analysis also applies for FPNS. In particular, this analysis gives the trivial result that the best-case computation time of a task is a lower bound for the best-case response time of such a task under FPNS. However, we would like to investigate whether this lower bound is tight for all cases.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the basic real-time scheduling model for FPTS as well as some related notions. The best-case response time for non-preemptive tasks is presented in Section 3. Section 4 introduces an example that shows that the best-case response time analysis for FPTS is most likely not a trivial extension of the current best-case analysis for FPPS. Finally, we conclude this paper in Section 5.

\section{Real-time scheduling model}
In this section, we present the real-time scheduling model for FPTS along with some related notions.

\subsection{Basic model for FPTS}
We assume a single processor and a set $\mathpzc{T}$ of $n$ independent periodic tasks $\tau_1,\tau_2,...,\tau_n$ with unique and fixed priorities $\pi_{1}$, $\pi_{2},...,\pi_{n}$. We also assume that tasks are given in order of decreasing priority, i.e. $\tau_1$ has the highest priority whereas $\tau_n$ has the lowest priority. A higher priority is represented by a higher value.

\begin{figure*}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{fig/task_model_2}
	\caption{Basic model for a periodic task $\tau_i$.}
	\label{fig:taskmodel}
\end{figure*}

Each task $\tau_i$ generates an infinite sequence of jobs $\iota_{ik}$ with $k\in \mathbb{Z}$. In addition, each task is characterized by a \textit{period} $T_i \in \mathbb{R^{+}}$, a \textit{worst-case computation time} $\wc_i \in \mathbb{R^{+}}$, a \textit{best-case computation time} $\bc_i \in \mathbb{R^{+}}$, where $\bc_i \leq \wc_i$, a \textit{phasing} $\phi_i \in \mathbb{R}$, a (relative) \textit{worst-case deadline} $\wcd_i \in \mathbb{R^{+}}$, and a (relative) \textit{best-case deadline} $\bd_i \in \mathbb{R^{+}}\cup \{0\}$, where $\bd_i \leq \wcd_i$. We assume arbitrary phasings. Moreover, the set of phasings $\phi_i$ is termed the phasing $\phi$ of the task-set $\mathpzc{T}$. Furthermore, we assume arbitrary deadlines; hence, deadline $\wcd_i$ may be smaller than, equal to, or larger than period $T_i$. In addition, we assume that tasks do not suspend themselves, jobs do not start before the completion of previous jobs of the same task, and the overhead of context switching and task scheduling is ignored.

For FPTS, each task $\tau_i$ has an additional property called \textit{preemption threshold} denoted by $\theta_i$, where $\pi_1 \geq \theta_i \geq \pi_i$. A task $\tau_i$ can be preempted by a higher priority task $\tau_h$ if and only if $\pi_h > \theta_i$. FPPS is a special case of FPTS when $\forall_{1\leq i \leq n}\theta_i = \pi_i$, and FPNS is a special case when $\forall_{1\leq i \leq n}\theta_i = \pi_1$.

It is worth noting that activation jitter is ignored in the real-time scheduling model under study. We aim to first investigate the best-case response times analysis for FPTS for the basic model before refining the model with the notion of activation jitter.

\subsection{Derived notions}
Given the \textit{activation time} $a_{i,k}$ of the $k^{th}$ job of a task $\tau_i$ and its (absolute) \textit{finalization time} $f_{i,k}$, the \textit{response time} $R_{i,k}$ of such a job is defined as the time elapsed between its finalization and activation, i.e. $R_{i,k}=f_{i,k}-a_{i,k}$. The \textit{absolute start time} $s_{i,k}$ is the time at which job $k$ of $\tau_i$ starts its execution. Furthermore, the \textit{relative start time} $S_{i,k}$ is the start time relative to the activation of a job, i.e. $S_{i,k}=s_{i,k}-a_{i,k}$. Finally, we define the \textit{hold time} $H_{i,k}$ as the time elapsed between the start of a job and its completion, this is expressed as $H_{i,k}=f_{i,k}-s_{i,k}$. In general, under this model, it always holds that $R_{i,k}=S_{i,k}+H_{i,k}$. Figure \ref{fig:taskmodel} shows the basic task model with these notions.

The \textit{worst-case response time} $\wr_i$ and the \textit{best-case response time} $\br_i$ of a task $\tau_i$ are defined as the longest and the shortest response times of its jobs respectively, i.e.
\begin{align}
	\wr_i \defeq \text{sup}_{\phi,k} R_{i,k}(\phi)\\
	\br_i \defeq \text{inf}_{\phi,k} R_{i,k}(\phi),
\end{align}
where $R_{i,k}(\phi)$ denotes a dependency of response time $R_{i,k}$ on phasing $\phi$.

We say that a set $\mathpzc{T}$ of $n$ periodic tasks is schedulable if and only if
\begin{align}
	\displaystyle\mathop{\forall}_{1 \leq i \leq n}(\bd_i\leq \br_i \land \wr_i \leq \wcd_i).
\end{align}

Finally, we introduce the notion of level-$i$ active period and best-case utilization. In order to define the notion of level-$i$ active period \cite{BLV09}, we first introduce the notion of pending load. The \textit{pending load} $P_i(t)$ of a task $\tau_i$ is defined as the amount of processing at time $t$ that still needs to be completed for the jobs with a priority higher than or equal to task $\tau_i$ that are activated before time $t$. A level-$i$ active period is then defined as the interval $[t_s,t_e)$ such that $P_i(t_s)=0$, $P_i(t_e)=0$, and $P_i(t)>0$ for all $t \in (t_s,t_e)$.

We define the best-case utilization $\bu^{\mathpzc{T}}$ as the best-case fraction of the  processor time spent on the execution of $\mathpzc{T}$, i.e.

%A common term used in the response-time analysis of scheduling policies is the notion of level-$i$ active period \cite{BLV09}. To define this notion, we first introduce the notion of pending load. The \textit{pending load} $P_i(t)$ of a task $\tau_i$ is defined as the amount of processing at time $t$ that still needs to be completed for the jobs with a priority higher than or equal to task $\tau_i$ that are activated before time $t$. A level-$i$ active period is then defined as the interval $[t_s,t_e)$ such that $P_i(t_s)=0$, $P_i(t_e)=0$, and $P_i(t)>0$ for all $t \in (t_s,t_e)$.
%
%Finally, we define the best-case utilization $\bu^{\mathpzc{T}}$ as the best-case fraction of the  processor time spent on the execution of $\mathpzc{T}$, i.e.
\begin{align}
\bu^{\mathpzc{T}} \defeq \sum_{1\leq i \leq n} \frac{\bc_i}{T_i}.
\end{align} 

\section{Best-case response time for non-preemptive tasks}
Since FPNS is a special case of FPTS when thresholds of tasks are set to the highest priority, we first investigate the best-case response time for non-preemptive tasks as an intermediate step towards the best-case analysis for FPTS.

\begin{lemma}
	\textit{Let $\tau_i$ be a non-preemptive task, i.e. $\theta_i = \pi_1$, and let $\bu^{\mathpzc{T}}<1$ or $\bu^{\mathpzc{T}}=1$ and the lcm of the periods exists. The \textit{best-case response time} of $\tau_i$ is always equal to its \textit{best-case computation time}, i.e. $\br_i = \bc_i$.}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	Given a task-set $\mathpzc{T}$ and a non-preemptive task $\tau_i \in \mathpzc{T}$, assume that all jobs of $\tau_i$ have a computation time equal to $\bc_i$. Since $\tau_i$ is non-preemptive, the hold time of all its jobs is simply equal to $\bc_i$. Recall that the response time of a job $k$ of $\tau_i$ is given by $R_{i,k}=S_{i,k}+H_{i,k}$. Therefore, in order to prove the lemma, it is sufficient to show that it is always possible to schedule task $\tau_i$ in such a way that the relative start time of a job $k$ of $\tau_i$ is zero, i.e. $S_{i,k}=0$. We divide this proof in two cases:
	
	\{\textit{Case $\bu^{\mathpzc{T}} < 1$}\}. Given an arbitrary schedule for $\mathpzc{T}$, let $[t_s,t_e)$ with $t_e > t_s$ be an idle interval in such a schedule, where an idle interval is a time interval in which there is no pending load. Note that it is always possible to find an idle interval because $\bu^{\mathpzc{T}} < 1$. Furthermore, let $\iota_{i,k}$  be the first job of $\tau_i$ activated at or after time $t_e$, i.e. $t_e \leq a_{i,k}$. We now show that, by pushing the activation of $\iota_{i,k}$ to occur in the interval $[t_s,t_e)$, the relative start time of $\iota_{i,k}$ becomes zero.
	
	First observe that there is no other job of $\tau_i$ between the idle interval $[t_s,t_e)$ and $\iota_{i,k}$. Hence, after pushing the activations of $\tau_i$ till $a_{i,k}$ occurs in $[t_s,t_e)$, job $\iota_{i,k}$ does not experience blocking by a previous job. Furthermore, since $[t_s,t_e)$ was originally idle, job $\iota_{i,k}$ can start upon activation, leading to $S_{i,k} = 0$.
	
	\{\textit{Case $\bu^{\mathpzc{T}} = 1$ and the lcm of the periods exists}\}. In
	order to prove this case, first recall that the hyperperiod is defined as the length of the shortest time interval in which the schedule repeats itself after an initial start-up. For a set of periodic tasks, Leung and Merrill proved in \cite{LM80} that the hyperperiod $H$ can be calculated as the least common multiple of the periods, i.e. $H=lcm(T_1,...,T_n)$ for $n$ periodic tasks. 
	
	Let $n_i = H/T_i$ be the number of jobs of $\tau_i$ in every hyperperiod and assume that no job of $\tau_i$ starts upon activation. Hence, for each interval $[a_{i,k^{\prime}},s_{i,k^{\prime}})$ with $1 \leq k^{\prime} \leq n_i$, there are only higher priority tasks of $\tau_i$ and/or at most one blocking lower priority task executing within such an interval. As an example of this situation, consider the timeline depicted in Figure \ref{fig:fpns1} for task-set $\mathpzc{T}_{\ref{tab:taskset1}}$ described in Table \ref{tab:taskset1}. As can be seen, no job of $\tau_2$ can start upon activation.
	
%	 Furthermore, let $\iota_{i,1}$ and $\iota_{i,n_i}$ be the first and last job of $\tau_i$ respectively in an hyperperiod.

			task & $T_i$ & $\wcd_i$ & $C_i$ & $\pi_i$ & $\theta_i$  \\ 
			\hline 
			$\tau_1$& 4 & 4 & 2  & 2 & 2\\ 
			$\tau_2$& 6 & 6 & 3  & 1 & 2\\ 
			\hline 
		\end{tabular}

		\item The hyperperiod is $H=12$ and $\bu^{\mathpzc{T_{\ref{tab:taskset1}}}}=1$.

		\label{fig:fpns1}
	\end{figure}
	
	Now let $\iota_{i,k}$ be the job of $\tau_i$ with the shortest relative start time among all jobs of $\tau_i$ in an hyperperiod. Since no job of $\tau_i$ starts upon activation, we can push the activation of all jobs of $\tau_i$ to a later moment in time, without modifying the schedule, till job $\iota_{i,k}$ starts upon activation. After pushing the activations of $\tau_i$, it holds that $S_{i,k}=0$ therefore concluding the proof. Figure \ref{fig:fpns2} shows an example where the schedule shown in Figure \ref{fig:fpns1} is preserved after pushing the activations of $\tau_2$ till its second job starts upon activation.	
%	
%		Now let $\iota_{i,k}$ be the job of $\tau_i$ with the shortest relative start time among all jobs of $\tau_i$ in an hyperperiod. Since no job of $\tau_i$ starts upon activation and $\iota_{i,k}$ is the job with the shortest start time, we can push

\section{Towards best-case analysis for FPTS}

In this section, we illustrate by means of an example that the best-case response time analysis for FPTS is most likely not a trivial extension of the existing best-case analysis for FPPS.
%
\subsection{Recap of optimal instant for FPPS}
An optimal instant is defined as the (hypothetical) instant that leads to the best-case response time of a task. For FPPS, the notion of optimal instant is the following \cite{BLM13}:
\begin{theorem}
	An optimal instant of a task $\tau_i$ under FPPS and arbitrary deadlines occurs when the completion of a job of task $\tau_i$ coincides with the simultaneous activation of all its higher priority tasks. 
\end{theorem}

It is worth noting that, for FPPS, the job experiencing the optimal instant is the job that assumes the best-case response time. Furthermore, such a job is also the last job in its level-$i$ active period.
%
%For FPNS, a conjecture of a so called $\Delta$-optimal instant is presented in \cite{BV05}. Based on this conjecture, a lower bound for the best-case response time under FPNS is also derived.
%
%\begin{conjecture}
%	A $\Delta$-optimal instant of a task $\tau_i$ under FPNS occurs when a job of $\tau_i$ starts a sufficintly small amount of time $\Delta > 0$ before the simultaneous activation of all its higher priority tasks.
%\end{conjecture} 

\subsection{An introductory example}
From Lemma 1, we can conclude that the best-case response time of a non-preemptive task  is independent of higher priority tasks. Based on this, it could be tentative to think that, given a task $\tau_i$ scheduled under FPTS, the best-case response time of $\tau_i$ would be independent of all its higher priority tasks that cannot preempt it, i.e. the tasks in $\{\tau_h | \theta_i \geq \pi_h > \pi_i\}$. However, this is not the case for FPTS as we show in the following example.

\begin{figure*}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.66\linewidth]{fig/fpps_fact1_3}
	\caption{A timeline for $\mathpzc{T}_{\ref{tab:taskset2}}$ depicting a level-3 active period. The best-case response time of $\tau_3$ is assumed by the first job in the level-3 active period.}
	\label{fig:fpps_fact1}
\end{figure*}

% The activation of the highest priority task $\tau_1$ coincides with the completion of job $\iota_{3,1}$ of task $\tau_3$ at time $t=0$. Furthermore, task $\tau_2$ is activated a small time $\Delta > 0$ after the start time of $\iota_{3,1}$.

%Based on the notion of optimal instant for FPPS, it could be tentative to think that an optimal instant for FPTS may occur when the completion of a job of a task $\tau_i$ coincides with the simultaneous activation of all higher priority tasks that can preempt $\tau_i$. These are the tasks in $\{\tau_h | \pi_h > \theta_i \}$. In this section, we introduce an example that refutes this intuition of optimal instant for FPTS.

%under FPTS, the best-case response time of a task $\tau_i$ could be found in a job which completion coincides with the simultaneous activation of all higher priority tasks that can preempt $\tau_i$. These are the tasks in $\{\tau_h | \pi_h > \theta_i \}$. In this section, we introduce an example that refutes this intuition.

\begin{table}[h]
	\center

	\label{tab:taskset2}
	\begin{tabular}{c | c c c c c | c c}
		\hline 
		task & $T_i$ & $\wcd_i$ & $\wc_i=\bc_i$ & $\pi_i$ & $\theta_i$ &  $\wr_i$ & $\br_i$\\ 
		\hline 
		$\tau_1$& 35 & 20 & 10 & 3 & 3 &  10 & 10\\ 
		$\tau_2$& 50 & 65 & 20 & 2 & 2 &  62 & 20\\ 
		$\tau_3$& 70 & 70 & 22 & 1 & 2 &  66 & 32\\
		\hline 
	\end{tabular}
	\small
	\item The \textit{least common multiple} of the periods is 350 and $\bu^{\mathpzc{T_{\ref{tab:taskset2}}}}=1$.
\end{table}

Consider the set $\mathpzc{T}_{\ref{tab:taskset2}}$ of three tasks with characteristics as described in Table \ref{tab:taskset2}. The best-case response time values in this table were found using brute force. This is, by considering the phasings $\phi_1 \in [0,35)$ and $\phi_2 \in [0,50)$ with a granularity of one time unit in the simulations, while fixing the phasing of $\tau_3$ to $\phi_3 = 0$. Furthermore, note that task $\tau_1$ can preempt task $\tau_3$ because $\pi_1 > \theta_3$. On the other hand, task $\tau_2$ cannot preempt task $\tau_3$ because $\pi_2 = \theta_3$. 


Figure \ref{fig:fpps_fact1} shows a timeline for task-set $\mathpzc{T}_{\ref{tab:taskset2}}$ where the best-case response time of task $\tau_3$ is assumed by the first job in the level-3 active period. As can be seen, this best-case response time is assumed when $\tau_3$ experiences one preemption by task $\tau_1$; hence, resulting in $\br_3 = 32$. However, when ignoring task $\tau_2$ from task-set $\mathpzc{T}_{\ref{tab:taskset2}}$, the best-case response time of task $\tau_3$ is reduced to $\br_3 = 22$. Based on this observation, we conclude that, in general, the best-case response time of a task $\tau_i$ is not independent of the higher priority tasks that cannot preempt $\tau_i$. Therefore, we formulate the following fact.

\begin{fact}
	In FPTS, the best-case response time of a preemptive task $\tau_i$, i.e. $\pi_1 > \theta_i$, can also be affected by a higher priority task that cannot preempt $\tau_i$.
\end{fact}

From Figure \ref{fig:fpps_fact1}, we can also observe that an activation of $\tau_1$ coincides with the completion of a job of $\tau_3$ at time $t=0$. This is similar to the notion of optimal instant for FPPS. However, the best-case response time is not assumed by such a job ending at time $t=0$. Therefore, we have a first witness of dissimilarity between the best-case response time analysis for FPPS and FPTS.

\begin{fact}
	In FPTS, a job k of task $\tau_i$ does not necessarily assume the best-case response time when the activation of all higher priority tasks that can preempt task $\tau_i$ coincides with the completion of job k.
\end{fact}

Furthermore, an important property in the best-case analysis for FPPS and arbitrary deadlines is that the last job in a level-$i$ active period always experiences the shortest response time of all jobs in that level-$i$ active period. This property was highlighted in \cite{BLM13} as a witness of non-duality between best-case and worst-case analysis. This property clearly does not hold for FPTS as shown in Figure \ref{fig:fpps_fact1}. As can be seen, the first job in the level-3 active period is the one with the shortest response time. Based on this, we introduce the following fact as second witness of dissimilarity between the best-case behavior of FPPS and FPTS.

\begin{fact}
	In FPTS, the shortest response time of a task $\tau_i$ in a level-$i$ active period is not necessarily assumed by the last job in that level-$i$ active period.
\end{fact}


%Therefore, we introduce the following fact.

%The worst-case response time values in Table \ref{tab:taskset2} were found by applying the worst-case response time analysis for FPTS in \cite{bibid}.


%Figure \ref{fig:fpps_fact1} shows a timeline for task-set $\mathpzc{T}_{\ref{tab:taskset2}}$ with the configuration that we aim to refute for the last job of task $\tau_3$. As can be seen, the completion of this job coincides with an activation of the highest priority task $\tau_1$ at time $t=0$. Note that task $\tau_1$ can preempt task $\tau_3$ because $\pi_1 > \theta_3$. On the other hand, task $\tau_2$ cannot preempt task $\tau_3$ because $\pi_2 = \theta_3$. For the latter reason, the activation of task $\tau_2$ is set to a sufficiently small amount of time $\Delta>0$ after the start time of the last job of task $\tau_3$, therefore, allowing more time before $t=0$ for the execution of task $\tau_3$. This is in accordance with the notion of $\Delta$-optimal instant.

%to an earlier moment in time in Figure \ref{fig:fpps_fact1}, allowing more time before $t=0$ for the execution of task $\tau_3$.

%As can be seen from Figure \ref{fig:fpps_fact1}, the last job of task $\tau_3$ that is experiencing the new optimal instant has a response time of $R_{3,1}=36$. However, the best-case response time of task $\tau_3$ is $\br_3 = 32$, and it is assumed by the job activated at time $t=-176$. Note also that the response time of the job experiencing the optimal instant cannot be reduced by pushing the activations of task $\tau_3$ because the job activated at time $t=-176$ already can start upon activation. Hence, pushing the activations of task $\tau_3$ to a later moment in time would modify the schedule.


%From Figure \ref{fig:fpps_fact1}, we can also observe that, in order to calculate the response time of job $\iota_{3,1}$, we have to look at previous jobs in the level-3 active period to see whether they induce some delay in the start time of $\iota_{3,1}$. This is similar to the best-case response time analysis for FPPS in \cite{BLM13}. An important property for this analysis, however, is that under FPPS the last job in a level-$i$ active period always experiences the shortest response time of all jobs in that level-$i$ active period. This property clearly does not hold for FPTS as shown in Figure \ref{fig:fpps_fact1}. As can be seen, the first job in the level-3 active period is the one with the shortest response time. Therefore, we introduce the following fact.

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we proved that the best-case response time of a non-preemptive task is equal to its best-case computation time when scheduled under FPTS or FPNS. In addition, we showed some witnesses of dissimilarity between the best-case behaviors of FPPS and FPTS. We therefore conclude that the best-case analysis for FPTS is most likely not a trivial extension of the current analysis for FPPS. An exact best-case response time analysis for FPTS is currently under study.
